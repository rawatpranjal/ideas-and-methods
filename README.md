## July 2025

- **Advertising & Autobidding Auctions**
  - [Incrementality Bidding & Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12809)
    A foundational paper unifying ad bidding, attribution, and experimentation using a continuous-time causal model.
  - [Efficiency of the First-Price Auction in the Autobidding World](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/fb6279dab0e9282261e43113-Abstract-Conference.html)
    A NeurIPS paper analyzing the price of anarchy (efficiency) of first-price auctions with a mix of traditional and automated bidders.

- **Causal Inference**
  - [Double machine learning to estimate the effects of multiple treatments and their interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12617)
    An arXiv paper proposing a Double Machine Learning framework to robustly estimate the causal effects of multiple simultaneous treatments.

- **Reinforcement Learning in Ride-share**
  - [Reinforcement Learning for Modeling Marketplace Balance](https://www.uber.com/blog/reinforcement-learning-for-modeling-marketplace-balance/)
    Uber Engineering's blog on using a DQN-like reinforcement learning model to improve marketplace efficiency.
  - [A Better Match for Drivers and Riders: Reinforcement Learning at Lyft](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2023.0083)
    Details Lyft's real-time reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes matching by estimating future driver earnings.

- **Safety in Ride Share and Severity-Frequency Modelling**
  - [How to Pick a Better Model (Model Lift)](https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/presentation/rpm_2016_presentations_pm-lm-4.pdf)
    A very useful primer on model evaluation in context of insurance. Covers lift, double-lift and loss charts, and Gini index for evaluating predictive models and model scores.
  - [Generalized Linear Models for Insurance Ratings]( https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/05-Goldburd-Khare-Tevet.pdf)
    Helpful primer in building severity-frequency models using Poisson and Gamma GLMs and then evaluating them.
  - [Service Quality in the Gig Economy: Empirical Evidence about Driving Quality at Uber](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/service-quality-gig-economy-empirical-evidence-about-driving)
    A Stanford paper showing how platform feedback systems improve service quality in the gig economy.
  - [Driver crash risk factors and prevalence evaluation using naturalistic driving data](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1513271113)
    A PNAS paper analyzing a large naturalistic driving dataset, showing driver-related factors are present in nearly 90% of crashes.
